## __Tracking pieces of my datascience study__

I've taught myself datascience since 2017. Before 2017, I didn't know anything about coding and I was a  super super python beginner. But, I'm pretty sure that I've been working hard for studying this. I'm not a master of those things, but I'm still trying to keep going.
